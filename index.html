        <h3>Adjustable Dumbbells</h3>
        <p>Dumbbells are usually an essential part of strength training and if you’ve ever gone to a proper gym they usually have a whole section entirely dedicated to dumbbells ranging from a few pounds to a few hundred pounds. It’s really a gym
          staple.

          Adjustable dumbbells are great because you don’t need to have 20 different dumbbells sitting in your home which takes up a lot of space, they are basically like your ordinary dumbbells except that the weight is not fixed. They tend to have
          a locking system and come with different plates of weights that you can fix to the dumbbell and then lock it.

          This makes it easy to start with a low number and then work your way up as you build upon your strength training, pretty neat right?</p>

        <h3>Adjustable KettleBells</h3>
        <p>Much like the adjustable dumbbells, adjustable kettlebells are similar in nature where you can increase the weight range of them and lock them into place. Some of them have a simple system where you just push a button to release the
          weights and then clip in further sizes, usually in 6-pound increments.

          Kettlebells are a lot more versatile than dumbbells because you can use them to do things such as goblet squats, as well as bicep curls and various other kettlebell exercises. They’re a great space saver as well as they can just sit in your
          wardrobe or in a corner.</p>

        <h3>Ab Wheel Rollers</h3>
        <p>You’ve probably seen these around at gyms, people usually look like they’re flattening out the pastry of a pizza base on the floor moving up and down. Those are called ab rollers, they can be used to train your core, hips, arms and back muscles and don’t require much room other than your body size.</p>

        <h3>Skipping Rope</h3>
        <p>If you’re opting for a cardio option instead of weights, then a skipping rope is always going to be a staple for any fitness enthusiast. You don’t need much room other than where you’re standing and if your place has a common area like a backyard or courtyard then you can simply take it out with you as it’s very mobile and light without much hassles.</p>
